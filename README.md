# SYSTEMFORGE

SystemForge is a comprehensive DevOps toolbox built in Rust, designed to streamline system monitoring, file management, and security tasks for developers and system administrators. The goal is to provide a unified tool that integrates multiple essential features for maintaining and optimizing system health, file security, and performance.

## Features

1. **Custom Shell**:

   - A developer-centric command-line interface (CLI) that integrates all system analysis tools, making them easily accessible through commands and shortcuts.

2. **File System Analyzer**:

   - Analyze the file system, displaying metadata (file size, file type, etc.), identifying large files, and showing overall disk usage. Recursive directory traversal and error handling are included.

3. **Disk Usage Analyzer**:

   - Provides insights into disk usage patterns, highlights large directories/files, and suggests optimizations for storage management.

4. **Log File Analyzer**:

   - Parses and filters logs from the system or applications, enabling real-time monitoring with alerts for specific events.

5. **File Encryption Tool**:

   - Offers easy encryption and decryption for files and folders to help secure sensitive data.

6. **System Monitor**:

   - Monitors CPU, memory, network usage, and other system metrics in real-time, with user-friendly reports and alerts on abnormal system behavior.

7. **Process Manager**:

   - Manages running processes, providing insights into CPU and memory consumption, and allows users to kill or prioritize processes.

8. **Network Packet Analyzer**:

   - Captures and analyzes network packets, giving developers visibility into which processes are using network resources and highlighting any suspicious activities.

9. **System Backup Tool**:

   - Provides file and directory backups, supporting incremental backups, file compression, and remote backups over the network.

10. **Custom Memory Allocator**:
    - Optimizes memory usage across the system, ensuring better performance and reduced memory fragmentation for system-intensive applications.

**Use Case**:

By the end of development, **SystemForge** will offer both a CLI and a desktop UI (built with Tauri) to make it accessible and easy to use, regardless of preference for command-line or graphical tools.
